  <h1>Git Gud?</h1>
  <h2>A Look Into Command Line and Git</h2>
  <h4>9/13/2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Kicking off our first week at Dev Bootcamp, we mainly focused on getting to know the in and outs of the command line, git, and git hub. 

      </p>
      <p>

      For those unfamiliar with the command line, imagine if you open up a blank word document (or any text editor for that matter). In this text editor, you can type anything you want, it just won't work 90% of the time if you do that. 

    </p>
    <p>

      For instance, pretend you're taking care of a group of kids.If you want them to listen to you, you can can't be all loosey-goosey with your orders, you have to be very specific and very commanding. "SIT DOWN!" *Hits kid in the back of the head*
</p>
<p>

      This is probably the reason why it's better that I'm going into web design, as hitting and yelling at a computer is much more acceptable than hitting and yelling at a child. 
</p>
<p>
      Essentially though, using the command line allows you manipulate and search around your files in a computer by just text commands. It's much faster than using your mouse and GUI (Graphics User Interface). The caveat though is that you have to remember specific terms to navigate around your computer as text is the only form of input that you have when using the command line.
    </p>
    <p>
      It makes sense that we started learning the command line first at DBC. Without the command line, it wouldn't be possible for us to know how to use git as the two go hand in hand together. 
</p>
<p>
      But before we start talking about git, let's talk a little bit about version control software first! The idea behind version control software is that anytime you make a change to a program, you can create a "patch" in a sense. You can apply this "patch" to your program, and it will make the changes that was listed in the patch. Usuall there's a master key (or master branch in this case) where the patch is applied to.
</p>
<p>
      Version control software is so useful because it allows many developers to work on the same program and apply their own "patches" to the master key.  Because all the changes are being tracked, when a developers wants to look at a piece of code they didn't work on but someone else did, they have "patch" notes that they can review and apply to their code and make their own "patch".

    </p>
    <p>
      Git and GitHub are both version control software. There's a major difference between the two however and that is git is used locally on your computer, while GitHub is a storage facility for code that is to be used remotely online.
</p>
<p>
      The best analogy that I heard this week was that think about Git and GitHub like files on your computer and Dropbox. Files you save on your computer are there locally, it isn't until you upload files to Dropbox are they online. 
</p>
<p>
      This is where knowing command line functions and git come in handy. Using the command line and git, you can take code that you created locally on your computer and upload them online to GitHub.
</p>
<p>
      This is extremely useful because as long as you have an internet connection, anyone can access your code from anywhere (provided you made your files public). So if you have mulitple developers working on the same project around the world, they can access your work the second you upload it to GitHub. Pretty handy right?
</p>
<p>
      And that about sums up what we learned in DBC phase 1. It's been a challenging week, definitely had some head banging moments. But once you get the hang of the material, there's a sweet sweet sense of satifaction and revenge. Bring on Week 2!
