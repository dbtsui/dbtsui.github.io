				<p>
				For this blog post, I would like to talk about the Enumerable#map method. Map is
				is really powerful method for Ruby that because you are able to take an array,
				make a transformation of it, and always get the same size array in return. This is
				really useful if say you want to take an array and do something to each element in the
				array. 
				</p>

				<p>
				For instance, say you want to capitalize each name in Array. This would be 
				useful for documentation purposes. You could use a code like this.

				<br>
				names["doug", "mango", "m2k", "ken"]
				<br>
				["doug", "mango", "m2k", "ken"]
				<br>

				names.map {|name|name.captitalize}
				<br>
				["Doug", "Mango", "M2k", "Ken"]
				<br>
				</p>

				<p>
				The main thing to keep in mind with map, is that the return value will always
				return an array. As pointed out in the Well-Grounded Rubyist, this distinction 
				separates map from "each" as "each" will always return its receiver. So you
				have to think carefully about which method you want to use. That about
				sums up this blog post.
