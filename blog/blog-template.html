How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
My pair Mr. John Field was perfectly enjoyable to be with. For this
challenge, I think it was both silly and  useful. It was silly in
a sense because I don't think we need to team up to set up
a template to a blog, especially after exercise 2.6

As for the useful part, John had more experience than me and 
was able to tell me HTML elements that I didn't know. I got
to learn things, but I don't think I was able to provide
anything back.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Well, I think it will always be useful to wireframe. It's like 
writing an outline before starting an essay. 

However, I don't find wireframing to be that useful right now because
what we can do with HTML is so limited. So even if we came up
with a great wireframe, we have no way to implement it. So now my
wireframes are things I draw in like 3 minutes, because I have
to keep it simple. 

I suppose it's good to start the habit now though.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
The information is clearly presented on the screen, and it
is easy to navigate throughout the site. 

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
John explained to me <footer>, <header>, <aside>, and <article>
He also gave me tips on proper formatting and how to do
autocomplete and what autofill was. I actually got to 
learn a lot through him, hopefully next time we pair,
I can help out a bit more.
