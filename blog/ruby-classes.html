				For week 6 at DBC, we spent a considerable amount of time thinking and learning about classes.
				Classes, in ruby, can be thought up as a way to format an object. Being an object oriented language,
				we come up with objects in Ruby all the time. Creating classes allows us to save time whenever
				we need to come up with objects of similiar nature.
				</p>


				<p>
				A common but good example are animals. Say you want to create a way to keep track of identify
				different animals. With Classes, you can create a Class call animal with can take in variables like
				number of legs, mammal, lifecycle, so on and so forth. We can also create methods as a way to futher
				identify an animal. 
				</p>

				<p>
				This is just a small idea in what you can achieve with the power of classes. Hopefully you can
				come up with better ideas than me, and if you do, feel free to share!
