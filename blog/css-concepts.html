				Hey everyone recently at Dev Bootcamp, we've been learning about HTML and CSS.
				A concept that I struggled a lot with while learning CSS was figuring out
				the difference between relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning. 

				</p>

				<p>

				Let's first talk about the property positioning when it comes to CSS. Positioning
				is how you display an element on a page. An element can be anything you define, it can
				be a line of text, a picture, a solid block you created, you name it. When it comes
				to displaying an elemnt on a page though you need to think about how you want to
				lable your positioning. This is where relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning come
				in.

				</p>

				I'll start with relative and go down the list. When you set an element to relative positioning,
				you're telling the element you will be "relative" to the point where you were originally
				suppose to be. 

				<p>

				For absolute, you can dictate where you want the element to exactley be, and it won't move
				no matter what you set your screen size to, the element will always remain in that position.

				</p>

				If you set an element to fixed, the element will always follow the viewer. For example, if you set
				a red square to the center of a page and make the element fixed, if the viewer scrolls the page
				up or down, the square will always remain in the center.

				<p>

				As for static, this is the default positioning state of element. If you haven't given it
				a positioning, it will be set to this. Static just means that the element will appear where 
				it is suppose to appear without any modifcations.

				</p>

				<p>

				And that's my short description for the difference between the positioning. 

				</p>
