			<h3> Blog Array and Hashes </h3>
			<!-- N will be the Blog Number you're on -->
				<p>
				In this blog post, I will discuss about two data structures. One is an array
				while the other is a hash. Arrays and Hashes are ways to organize your information.
				The biggest difference between the two would be how they are Index.
				</p>

				<p>
				Arrays are indexed by a number value that starts at 0. When you need to store or access
				information from an array, you have to decide where that information is in the array. Where
				it is, is defined by a number. The difference with hashes is that, hashes are indexed by
				a key and are always paired with a value. They key is usually a "string", though it can
				be anything really.
				</p>

				<p>
				As when to use an array over a hash or vice versa, it comes down to what kind of list
				you want to make and how you want to look up information. To tell the truth after researching,
				I'm still not sure what's the absolute rule of when to use an array or hash. It sounds like
				you want to use the one that would reduce run time, which makes sense. Like in the case of searching
				for a word and defintion in a dictionary. You would want to use a hash over to array. But
				I don't know what the hard line rule is. Guess that will be something I'll keep in mind.
