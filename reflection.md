What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I don't think I used padding or border in my challenge. Didn't feel like it was
necessary to achieve the scope that I wanted for my website. Probably in the future I will though
since I should pratice these CSS element.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

It's frustrating and confusing. I still mess up on position fixed, absolute, static, and relative even though
I think I understand them conceptually. I forced certain elements of my templates to look a certain way
instead of making it flexible and responsive which I'm pretty sure is the wrong way to do this challenge.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Adding color was the easiest. Everything else was diffcult.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I never want to do HTML/CSS in my life and should avoid front-end development unless I want myself to be miserable.
